## Joke Machine 1

Use Postman to fetch a random joke from the Random Joke API and inspect the result.

## Joke Machine 2

With the files tell-me-a-joke.html and tell-me-a-joke.js, build a page with an empty paragraph element and a single button that says. "Tell me a joke." When the button is clicked, the page should fetch a joke from the Random Joke API and display it in the paragraph element.

If a joke is already displayed when the button is clicked, it should be replaced by a new joke.
