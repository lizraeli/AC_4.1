# Project - Navigation Menu

## Instructions

For this exercise, we'd like you to link some pages together with a navigation menu to create a multi-page website. This is one common way in which a website is created — the same page structure is used on every page, including the same navigation menu, so when links are clicked it gives the impression that you are staying in the same place, and different content is being brought up.

You'll need to make local copies of the following four pages, all in the same directory (see also the [navigation-menu-start](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/master/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start) directory for a full file listing):

* [index.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/index.html)
* [projects.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/projects.html)
* [pictures.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/pictures.html)
* [social.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/navigation-menu-start/social.html)

You should:

1. Add an unordered list in the indicated place on one page, containing the names of the pages to link to. A navigation menu is usually just a list of links, so this is semantically ok.
2. Turn each page name into a link to that page.
3. Copy the navigation menu across to each page.
4. On each page, remove just the link to that same page — it is confusing and pointless for a page to include a link to itself, and the lack of a link acts a good visual reminder of what page you are currently on.

The finished example should end up looking something like this:
