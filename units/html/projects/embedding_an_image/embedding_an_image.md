# Project - Embedding an Image

[Source: Images in HTML, by Mozilla Contributors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML)

## Instructions

### First Exercise

Embed the following image in an HTML document:

![dinosaur](assets/image.jpg)

Also, do the following:

* Add some alt text, and check that it works by misspelling the image URL.
* Set the image's correct `width` and `height` (hint; it is 200px wide and 171px high), then experiment with other values to see what the effect is.
* Set a `title` on the image.

### Second Exercise

In this active learning section, we'd like you to take the finished code from the previous active learning section, and turn it into a figure:

* Wrap it in a [`<figure>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure "The HTML <figure> element represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption (<figcaption>), and is typically referenced as a single unit.") element.
* Copy the text out of the `title` attribute, remove the `title` attribute, and put the text inside a [`<figcaption>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption "The HTML <figcaption> element represents a caption or a legend associated with a figure or an illustration described by the rest of the data of the <figure> element which is its immediate ancestor.") element below the image.
