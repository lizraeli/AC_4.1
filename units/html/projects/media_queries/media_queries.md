## Instructions

### Strawberries - Sidebar

1. Build a page called about strawberries that includes a left sidebar. The left sidebar will use `position: absolute` and `width: 20%`. The main content of the page will be to the right of the sidebar. The sidebar should include three links to other pages about strawberries.

2. Build a rule with `@media print` and `display: none` to hide the sidebar when a user attempts to print the page. When a user prints, the main content of the page should occupy the full width of the page.

3. **Bonus**: Make the sidebar dissapear on small devices. Have a top, inline menu appear instead. The menu should stay at the top of the page even when scrolling down.

### Bears - Mobile

Build a page about bears with a font size of 24 pixels and a width of `40em`. The content should be centered in the browser window. Build a `@media` query to target devices with a width of less than 961 pixels. These devices should display the page with a width of `30em`.
