# Project: Basic ​Calculator

Use the following files as a starting point for a basic calculator web app:

* [html](assets/calc.html)
* [css](assets/calc.css)
* [js](assets/calc.js)

## Instructions

Edit the project files to achieve the following:

1. When the user clicks on one of the operator buttons  (`+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`), the operator is displayed.

2. When the user clicks on the `=` button, the result of the calculation is displayed. Use the provided `calculate` function.

3. When a user clicks on the same operator two or more times times, any click after the first has no effect.

E.g. If the user just clicked on `+`, and she then clicks on `+` again, the second click has no effect.

4. When the user clicks on the `​C`​ ​button​, ​the​ ​display is cleared.

5. Edit​ ​​ _calc.css_ ​​​so​ ​that​ ​the​ ​page​ ​uses​ ​a​ ​calculator-specific​ font​ ​like​ ​​Orbitron​.

6. Edit​ ​​ _calc.css_ ​ ​​so​ ​that​ ​the​ ​text​ ​of​ ​​outputDiv​​ ​is​ right-aligned.

7. Edit _calc.css_ to display a different cursor when the mouse hovers on any of the buttons.

7. Generate​ ​a​ ​​favicon​​ ​and​ ​link​ ​to​ ​it​ ​from​ ​​ _calc.html_.

8. **bonus** set a maximum length to the input *and* output of the calculator.
