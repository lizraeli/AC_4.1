## Instructions

Your task is to create a cool, fancy box.

Start by copying the following files to a new local folder:

* [HTML](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/styling-boxes/cool-information-box-start/index.html)
* [CSS](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/styling-boxes/cool-information-box-start/style.css).

### Styling the box

We'd like you to style the provided [`<p>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p "The HTML <p> element represents a paragraph of text."), giving it the following:

* A reasonable width for a large button, say around 200 pixels.
* A reasonable height for a large button, centering the text vertically in the process.
* Centered text.
* A slight increase in font size, to around 17-18px computed style. Use rems. Write how you worked the value out in a comment.
* A base color for the design. Give the box this color as its background color.
* The same color for the text; make it readable using a black text shadow.
* A fairly subtle border radius.
* A 1 pixel solid border with a color similar to the base color, but a slightly darker shade.
* A linear semi-transparent black gradient that goes towards the top left corner. **Bonus**: Make the gradient completely transparent at the start, gradiating to around 0.2 opacity by 30% along, and remaining at the same color until the end.
* Multiple box shadows. Give it one standard box shadow to make the box look slightly raised off the page. The other two should be inset box shadows â€” a semi transparent white shadow near the top left and a semi transparent black shadow near the bottom right, to add to the nice raised 3D look of the box.

## Example

The following screenshot shows an example of what the finished design could look like:
