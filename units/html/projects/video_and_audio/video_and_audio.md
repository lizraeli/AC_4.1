# Project - Embedding your own audio and video

[Source: Video and audio content, by Mozilla Contributors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

## Instructions

Use any of the following [audio and video files](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/master/html/multimedia-and-embedding/video-and-audio-content), or any of your own, to complete this exercise.

1. Save the audio and video files in a new directory on your computer.
2. Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called `index.html`.
3. Add `<audio>` and `<video>` elements to the page; make them display the default browser controls.
4. Give both of them `<source>` elements so that browsers will find the audio format they support best and load it. These should include `type` attributes.
5. Give the `<video>` element a poster that will be displayed before the video starts to be played.

### Bonus

Research `text tracks`, and try to add captions to your video.
