1. Create a variable called `num` with the value `8`. Use the assignment operator to change the value of `num` to `10`
2. Define a variable `num1` and another variable `num2`. compare the two variables: if both are equal print "they are equal", if not print "nope".
3. Write `if - else if - else` statements that check the value of variable `numOfSheep`. If the value is `1` - print "just one sheep?", if it is `2 `- print "you got two sheeps man". If it is 3, print "that's a lot of sheep".
