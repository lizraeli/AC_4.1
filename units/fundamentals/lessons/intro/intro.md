## Logic Puzzles

### Hats

Cannibals ambush a safari in the jungle and capture three people. The cannibals give the people a single chance to escape uneaten.

The captives are lined up in order of height, and are tied to stakes. The person in the rear can see the backs of his two friends, the person in the middle can see the back of the person in front, and the person in front cannot see anyone. The cannibals show the people five hats. Three of the hats are black and two of the hats are white.

Blindfolds are then placed over each person's eyes and a hat is placed on each person's head. The two hats left over are hidden. The blindfolds are then removed and it is said to the people that if one of them can guess what color hat he is wearing they can all leave unharmed.

The person in the rear who can see both of his friends' hats but not his own says, "I don't know". The middle one (who can see the hat of the person in front), says "I don't know". The front person who cannot see ANYBODY'S hat says "I know!".

How did he know the color of his hat and what color was it?

### Island of Truthtellers and Liars

The island has only one city, the capital, Quandary. Its population is made up entirely of members of two groups, the Truthtellers and the Liars. The Truthtellers always say the truth, and the Liars always lie. The members of each tribe can always recognize who is or isn't a member of their tribe.

Ellen decided that her best course was to reach the capital. Walking from the beach, she came to a road that split in two and saw a man and a woman: she could tell for sure they were members of opposite tribes, but she could not tell who of them belonged to which one.

With one question, Helen found out which way she should go to reach the capital. What was the question?

### Deadly Choice

A man is caught on the King's property. He is brought before the King to be punished.

The King says, "You must give me a statement. If it is true, you will be killed by lions. If it is false, you will be killed by trampling of wild buffalo."

But in the end, the King has to let the man go.

What was the man's statement?

### Farmer Crosses River

A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage.

There is a boat that can fit herself plus either the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.

If the wolf and the goat are alone on one shore, the wolf will eat the goat. If the goat and the cabbage are alone on the shore, the goat will eat the cabbage.

How can the farmer bring the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage across the river?
