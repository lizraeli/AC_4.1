Objects are often useful when combined with arrays. For example,  may want to create several we may want to create an array of objects, where each objects has the same properties. One such example is the films array from our first **Objects** lesson:

```js
var films = [
  {
    name: 'Psycho',
    director: 'Alfred Hitchcock',
    released: 1960
  }, {
    name: 'Citizen Kane',
    director: 'Orson Welles',
    released: 1941
  }, {
    name: 'The Usual Suspects',
    director: 'Bryan Singer',
    released: 1995
  }
]
```

Back then we create a function `addFilm` to make adding films easier.

```js
function addFilm(name, director, released){
  films.push({
    name: name,
    director: director,
    released: released
  })
}

addFilm('The Truman Show', 'Peter Weir', 1998)
```

We can also create a function that, whenever called, will return a new `film` object. We call this kind of function a **factory function**.

```js
function createFilm(name, director, released){
  var film = {
    name: name,
    director: director,
    released: released
  }

  return film
}

var myFilm = createFilm('The Truman Show', 'Peter Weir', 1998)
```

A variable that is defined within a function is created anew every time the function is called. When we get to the end of a function, the variables that have been created within it are forgotten. We can, however, return a variable that was created inside a function. The variable itself will be forgotten, but its value will be assigned to a variable that lives outside the function. So, in the above example, we are assigning the value of the `film` variable from inside the function to the `myFilm` variable outside the function.

An advantage of a factory functions is that we can insure that each object will have the same properties. This will make it easier to with an array of objects later on. In our films example, when we only use the `createFilm` function to add new films to the films array, we can then create a function to get the film title for any film in the array.

```js
function logTitle(film){
  console.log(film.title)
}

films.push(createFilm('The Truman Show', 'Peter Weir', 1998))
films.push(createFilm('Citizen Kane', 'Orson Welles', 1941))
films.push(createFilm('The Usual Suspects', 'Bryan Singer', 1995))

logTitle(films[2])
// will log: 'The Usual Suspects'
```

We can now use the `getTitle` function as input to a `forEachElem` function, that applies a callback function to each element in an array.

```js
function forEachElem(arr, callback){
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    callback(arr[i])
  }
}

forEachElem(films, logTitle)
// will log:
// The Truman Show
// Citizen Kane
// The Usual Suspects
```

We can rewrite the second argument for `forEachElem` as an anonymous callback function:

```js
forEachElem(films, function(film){
  console.log(film.title)
})
```
