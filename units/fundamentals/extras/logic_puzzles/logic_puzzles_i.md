## Island of Truthtellers and Liars

The island's population is made up entirely of members of two groups, the Truthtellers and the Liars. The Truthtellers always say the truth, and the Liars always lie. The members of each tribe can always recognize who is a member of their own tribe and of the other tribe. Outsiders, on the other hand, can never tell who is a member of which tribe by appearance.

So she asked `B`, "What did `A` say?". `B` replied, "`A` said that he is a liar". At the point `C` said, "Don't believe `B`, he is lying!". What tribe do `B` and `C` belong to?
