## Lesson

### Higher Order Functions

A higher order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument. We have been using one such function in the previous lessons: `forEachElem` - which takes as arguments an array and a function, and executes that function for every element of the array. `filter` is another function that takes an array and a function as arguments.
