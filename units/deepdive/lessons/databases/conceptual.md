## Why do we need databases?

The JavaScript objects you create and the HTTP queries you make don't, by themselves, save anything after a user exits your application. This isn't much like the web apps that you're probably used to. For example, Facebook stores your messages, post history, images, etc., such that whenever and wherever you log in, that stuff will be there—in developer-speak, it will *persist*.

You can probably imagine how you might save things with the tools you have now. You'd go into your JSON objects, you'd set keys to point to different values, and you'd save the file.

However, this method is limited in lots of ways. For example, what if you wanted to get the image URLs of photos of a user posted by that user's friends, but not by the user themselves? This seems like an edge case, but in fact, it's not that unusual—if you look at "advanced search" sections of websites you browse, you'll see all sorts of powerful, complex ways you can sort information.

This is where databases come in. More specifically, this is where **relational databases** come in.

## Relational databases

Relational databases are sometimes referred to as RDBMS, or Relational Database Management Systems. RDBMS store data in **tables**, which are exactly like they sound—not too different from Excel spreadsheets or any other way you've seen to store data in rows and columns.

For example:

| id            | title          | year  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
|1|Reservoir Dogs|1992|
|2|Pulp Fiction|1994|
|3|Jackie Brown|1997|
|4|Kill Bill Vol. 1|2003|
|5|Kill Bill Vol. 2|2004|

True to their name, relational databases *relate* tables to one another. For example, above is our movies table, and there may be a directors table, and directors can have many movies. With this relationship in place, we can **query** our database to extract (in an easy way, without messy if/else statements or string comparison) all the movies a particular director has made.

We can even drill down further. If we had an actors table, for example, we could potentially query the database to find all of the movies an actor and a director have made together.

In the above example, the **id** column is key to accomplishing this. In fact, it's so key, it's known as our **primary key**. We might have a column called director_ids, containing the ids of corresponding directors for our movies. In the movies table, the director ids are known as **foreign keys**.

Let's see how that might look:

| id            | title          | year  | director_id  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- | --------- |
|1|Reservoir Dogs|1992|32|
|2|Pulp Fiction|1994|32|
|3|Jackie Brown|1997|32|
|4|Kill Bill Vol. 1|2003|32|
|5|Kill Bill Vol. 2|2004|32|

In this table's case, we are just referring to Quentin Tarantino movies, so the director_id would be the same. However, we can store all sorts of movies this way, from all sorts of different directors, without a problem.

### Challenge

You are designing the database for Facebook. How do you organize the tables? How do the tables relate to one another? Feel free to discuss this in groups.

Organize your abstract database *schema* as follows:

```
Table USERS
Has many POSTS
Belongs to GROUPS
```
etc.

Questions to consider:
* What parts of Facebook make the cut to have their own tables?
* What parts are just columns in a table?
* How do your connections between tables allow you to access and sort information?

## Interacting With Databases

By this point, you might be asking yourself: "Okay. I understand (sort of) how tables are set up, but I still don't know how I'd use JavaScript to interact with them."

This makes sense! JSON files are accessible in the same way regular old JS objects are—you just key in to grab values. There isn't a clear way to do this with our relational tables.

The answer is something called **SQL**—or, "Structured Query Language." We won't get too deep into SQL at this point, but for now, just know that it doesn't look too much like JavaScript at all. It's a whole other language, designed for one specific purpose—to extract, add, change, and remove data from relational databases.

It looks something like this:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  movies
WHERE
  movies.director_id = 32
```

Abstracted, many SQL queries look like this:

```sql
SELECT
  columns
FROM
  table
WHERE
  conditions
```
