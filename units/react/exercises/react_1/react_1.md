# React 1 - Exercises

## Counter 1

Create a react component with two buttons - plus (`+`) and minus (`-`), and the text `The count is _`. The count should start at `0`. Every time the `+` button is clicked, add `1` to the count. Every time the `-` button is clicked, subtract `1` from the count. Use the component's `state` to keep track of the count.

## Counter 2

Add a `reset` button that will set the count to `0`.

## Counter 3

Add a `random` button that will set the count to a whole random number between `1` and `10`.
